# Push_swap

## Overview
Push_swap is a project from 42 School that involves sorting a list of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of operations.

## Features
- Validates input and ensures correct formatting.
- Implements stack operations for sorting.
- Optimized sorting strategies for different input sizes.
- Handles edge cases such as duplicates and invalid inputs.

## Compilation
To compile the project, run:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the `push_swap` executable.

## Running the Program
To run the program with a list of numbers:

```bash
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
