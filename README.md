# Push_swap

## Overview
Push_swap is a project from 42 School that requires implementing a sorting algorithm using only a limited set of stack operations. The goal is to efficiently sort a list of integers using the fewest number of operations.

## Features
- Parses and validates input numbers.
- Uses stack operations to sort numbers.
- Implements efficient sorting algorithms for different stack sizes.
- Handles edge cases like duplicates and invalid inputs.
- Optimized for minimal moves.

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the program, run:
```bash
make
