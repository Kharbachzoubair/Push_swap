### 🚀 Push_swap

## 📌 Overview
Push_swap is a project from 42 School that involves sorting a list of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of operations.

## ✨Features
- ✅ Validates input and ensures correct formatting.
- ✅ Implements stack operations for sorting.
- ✅ Optimized sorting strategies for different input sizes.
- ✅ Handles edge cases such as duplicates and invalid inputs.

## Compilation
To compile the project, run:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the `push_swap` executable.

## ▶️ Running the Program
To run the program with a list of numbers:

```bash
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```

## 🔄 Stack Operations
The following stack operations are implemented:

- 🔄 `sa`, `sb`, `ss` → Swap top two elements of the stack(s).
- 📤`pa`, `pb` → Push top element from one stack to another.
- 🔁`ra`, `rb`, `rr` → Rotate stack (shift elements up).
- 🔄`rra`, `rrb`, `rrr` → Reverse rotate stack (shift elements down).

## 📂 File Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

### 🏗 Core Files  
- **`push_swap.h`** - Header file with function prototypes  
- **`main.c`** - Entry point of the program  

### ✅ Input & Validation  
- **`validation.c`** - Handles input validation  

### 📌 Stack Operations  
- **`stack.c`** - Stack initialization and management  
- **`stack_utils.c`** - Helper functions for stack manipulation  
- **`swap.c`** - Swap operations (`sa`, `sb`, `ss`)  
- **`push.c`** - Push operations (`pa`, `pb`)  
- **`rotate.c`** - Rotate operations (`ra`, `rb`, `rr`)  
- **`reverse_rotate.c`** - Reverse rotate operations (`rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`)  

## 📊 Sorting Algorithm

The sorting strategy is optimized based on the number of elements:

- 🏆 **3 elements:** Uses a minimal set of swaps and rotations to achieve the correct order.
- 🎯 **5 elements:** Implements a more efficient small-sort strategy to minimize operations.
- 🚀 **More elements:** Uses a **range-based sorting algorithm**, pushing elements in sorted chunks to optimize the move count.
